# UX
A new language that is crated for maximum user/coder experience.

# Source code expresiveness
Source code will be more expressive (font, size, color, sub/superscript etc) than an IDE can possibly make text based files for other mainstream languages. Source files will not be pure text but more have a relationship that works like XHTML + CSS, ther the source file is the XHTML and the CSS is the language dialect that will be presented, possibly with per coder alterations. The XHTML is the structure of the programme, almost like an AST.
